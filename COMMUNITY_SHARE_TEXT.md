**Title**: [Project] 142 World-Class Expert Personas with Full Knowledge Bases (v3.0)

**Body**:

I'm excited to share v3.0 of **World-Class Leadership Personas** - a collection of 142 expert AI personas, each backed by comprehensive knowledge base documents!

## What's Different About This?

- 💻 **Production-ready code** (Python, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, SQL, Bash)
- 🔧 **Real-world workflows** and step-by-step guides
- ⚡ **CLI commands** (AWS, Azure, GCP, kubectl, Docker, Terraform)
- 🎯 **Industry frameworks** and best practices

## Example Use Cases

**DevOps Engineer** (`132-devops-engineer`):
- Get complete Kubernetes deployment configs
- CI/CD pipeline examples (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Terraform infrastructure as code (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring setup

**Nurse Practitioner** (`710-nurse-practitioner`):
- Primary care protocols (HTN, diabetes, depression)
- Prescribing guidelines and antibiotic stewardship
- Clinical assessment frameworks
- Patient education strategies

**Machine Learning Engineer** (`403-machine-learning-engineer`):
- Complete ML pipelines (training, deployment, monitoring)
- PyTorch neural networks
- Feature engineering techniques
- FastAPI model deployment

## Multi-IDE Support

Works with:
- ✅ Claude Desktop
- ✅ Cursor
- ✅ Windsurf (Codeium)
- ✅ Cline (VS Code)

All via Model Context Protocol (MCP) - install once, works everywhere!

## Statistics

- **142 Personas** across 9 categories
- **1000+ lines per document** of expert content
- **100% free and open source** (MIT License)
- **Production-ready** code and examples

## Get Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanshin0214/world-class-leadership-personas.git
cd world-class-leadership-personas
npm install
npm run build
```

Then configure your IDE (detailed instructions in README).

**GitHub**: https://github.com/seanshin0214/world-class-leadership-personas

Would love your feedback! ⭐ if you find it useful.

### r/devops
```markdown
**Title**: [Tool] DevOps Persona with Production-Ready Configs (Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD)

**Body**:

Built a comprehensive **DevOps Engineer** persona as part of a larger project, and thought the devops community might find it useful!

## What's Included

The persona includes 1000+ lines of production-ready documentation:

### CI/CD Pipelines
- **GitHub Actions**: Complete workflows (test, build, deploy)
- **GitLab CI**: Multi-stage pipelines with caching
- Docker multi-stage builds
- Deployment strategies

### Kubernetes
- Deployment, Service, Ingress manifests
- ConfigMaps, Secrets management
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler
- Helm charts
- kubectl command reference

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: AWS (ECS, RDS, VPC), Azure, GCP examples
- Variables, outputs, modules
- State management
- Best practices

### Monitoring
- Prometheus + Grafana setup
- Application metrics (Python Flask example)
- Alertmanager configuration
- Dashboard examples

## How It Works

Uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Claude/Cursor/Windsurf/Cline:

```
You: "@persona:132-devops-engineer Show me Kubernetes deployment best practices"
AI: [References knowledge base and provides complete config with explanations]
```

It's like having a senior DevOps engineer on-demand!

## Part of Larger Project

This is one of **142 personas** covering engineering, healthcare, business, creative, etc. All with same level of detail.

**GitHub**: https://github.com/seanshin0214/world-class-leadership-personas

Free and open source (MIT). Feedback welcome!

## 🗨️ Hacker News

```markdown
**Title**: Show HN: 142 World-Class AI Personas with Comprehensive Knowledge Bases

**URL**: https://github.com/seanshin0214/world-class-leadership-personas

**Comment (if needed)**:

I spent months building comprehensive knowledge bases for 142 expert personas across engineering, healthcare, business, creative fields, and more.

What makes this different from typical prompt libraries:

1. **Real expertise**: Each persona has 1000+ lines of documentation with industry-standard frameworks, not just generic templates.

2. **Production-ready code**: Includes working examples in Python, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, SQL, Bash with configurations for AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, etc.

3. **Works everywhere**: Uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) so it works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline (VS Code).

4. **Quality-first approach**: Every document carefully researched. No shortcuts or compressed content.

Some examples:
- DevOps Engineer: Complete CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes configs, Terraform IaC
- Nurse Practitioner: Clinical protocols, prescribing guidelines, patient care
- ML Engineer: PyTorch models, feature engineering, deployment with FastAPI
- Music Producer: DAW workflows, mixing/mastering, production techniques

All 100% free and open source (MIT).

Would love to hear HN's thoughts on the approach and whether you find specific personas useful!

## 📰 Dev.to / Medium Article Template

```markdown
# How I Built 142 Expert AI Personas with Real Knowledge Bases

## The Problem

Most AI persona libraries are just prompt templates. They give your AI a "role" but no real expertise. 

Want a DevOps engineer persona? You get generic advice about "containerization" and "infrastructure as code" - but no actual Kubernetes configs or Terraform examples.

## The Solution

I spent months building **comprehensive knowledge bases** for 142 expert personas. Not just prompts - real documentation with:

- Production-ready code examples
- Industry-standard frameworks
- Step-by-step workflows
- CLI commands and configurations

## What's Inside

### Engineering Personas

**DevOps Engineer** (`132-devops-engineer`):
```yaml
# Real Kubernetes deployment from the knowledge base
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  # ... (complete working config)
```

**Mobile Developer** (`106-mobile-developer`):
```swift
// Real SwiftUI code from the knowledge base
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var items: [Item] = []
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            // ... (complete working code)
        }
    }
}
```

### Healthcare Personas

**Nurse Practitioner** (`710-nurse-practitioner`):
- Comprehensive health assessment (HPI, ROS, physical exam)
- Treatment protocols (HTN, diabetes, depression)
- Prescribing guidelines and antibiotic stewardship
- Motivational interviewing techniques

### Business Personas

**Product Manager** (`301-product-manager`):
- Product discovery frameworks
- Prioritization methods (RICE, Kano, Value vs Effort)
- Roadmap planning
- Metrics and analytics (AARRR, cohort analysis)

## How It Works

Uses **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - the new standard for AI tool integration:

1. Install the MCP server (one time)
2. Configure your IDE (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or Cline)
3. Call personas like `@persona:132-devops-engineer`
4. Get expert guidance backed by comprehensive knowledge

## The Stats

- **142 personas** across 9 categories
- **1000+ lines** of documentation per persona
- **Production-ready** code in 7+ languages
- **100% free** and open source (MIT)

## Try It Yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanshin0214/world-class-leadership-personas.git
cd world-class-leadership-personas
npm install
npm run build
```

Full instructions: https://github.com/seanshin0214/world-class-leadership-personas

## Lessons Learned

1. **Quality > Quantity**: Better to have 10 well-documented personas than 100 generic prompts
2. **Real Examples**: Code snippets must be production-ready, not toys
3. **Industry Standards**: Reference actual frameworks (SOLID, Kubernetes, clinical guidelines)
4. **Multi-Platform**: MCP makes it easy to work with any AI coding assistant

## What's Next

- Community contributions (submit your expert personas!)
- More domains (legal, finance, government)
- Integration with VS Code Marketplace
- Persona marketplace with revenue sharing for creators

→ Get complete code with data loading, training loop, evaluation

Business: "@persona:301-product-manager How do I prioritize features?"
→ Get RICE, Kano, Value vs Effort frameworks with examples

[3:00 - Multi-IDE Support]
Works with:
- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Cline (VS Code)

One install via Model Context Protocol.

[3:30 - Setup]
Simple setup:
